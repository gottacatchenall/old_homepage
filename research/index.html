<p>I&rsquo;m broadly interested in theoretical and computational ecology, with an emphasis on
developing methods and tools to understand and predict the effects of anthropogenic change
on biodiversity. In particular, I&rsquo;m interested in the application of ecological network theory to
questions about the dynamics and persistence of metacommunities during periods of rapid environmental
and landscape change, and how to best make conservation decisions to protect biodiversity using this framework. This research spans topics in various subfields of ecology and evolution, including landscape ecology, niche theory, evolutionary ecology, and many more.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gottacatchenall/mpfm">source code</a></p>

<p>For my master&rsquo;s thesis, I&rsquo;ve developed a individual-based model of populations in fragmented
habitats. Understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation is one of the most pressing issues in
conservation today, and simulation models like <em>mpfm</em> enable us to understand how various different
properties of the landscape, including patch isolation, environmental heterogeneity/autocorrelation,
and isolation-by-distance strength affect the dynamics of populations in fragmented landscapes.</p>

<p>The recent availability of large amounts of genomic data has enabled the rapid growth of the field of
<em>landscape genetics</em>, which aims to understand how landscape properties affect population genetic structure, and make inferences about landscape features using genomic data. <em>mpfm</em> is a useful tool for testing the limitations of sampling schemes, and for constructing expectations from null-hypotheses of landscape structure.</p>
